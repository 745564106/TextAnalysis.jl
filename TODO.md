* Support both sparse and non-sparse matrices.
* Provide basic document similarity metrices.
* Provide simple clustering:
  * TD-IDF
  * pLSA
  * Fixed Topic LDA
  * Infinite Topic LDA

* Need to experiment with other data structures for representing a corpus.
* Need to experiment with better tokenizers.
* Need to decide when corpus cleaning should take place.
  * Possibly at corpus creation and also after. (Make EDA easier.)
